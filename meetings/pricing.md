# Pricing

Rooms are earmarked in points. The number of points for a room is priced based on location, availability, and the features of that specific room. Rooms can be categorized as, for instance, “Meeting”, “Conference”, “Phone Booths”, “Capsules, and “Sound-Proof Boxes”, etc.

Happy Hours: price of rooms vary depending on the time of the day, for instance, weekends are cheaper, so are non-AC hours (later evening).

Set a base per-minute price and then multiply that to the what the business defines as a slot (default: 30-min).

- Premium: Non-Members pay full price.
- Discounted: Members (default 50% discount).
