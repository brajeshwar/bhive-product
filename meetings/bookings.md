The Bookings shows the list of Meeting Rooms bookings with details and actionable buttons/links for the right user roles.

## Add Booking

For user with Booking rights, she can book a Meeting room from the primary button to [Add Booking](/meetings/booking-add-edit/).

## Stats at a Glance

The user can see the current statistics of Bookings at a glance â€” Total Bookings, Confirmed, Cancelled, etc.

## Filter with Search

As introduced earlier in Customer Listings at Infinity, we will continue to use the same interface where `Filters` and a `Search` will make it easy for the users to search/filter data.

The Date is a Range.

## Tabular Listings

1. `Booking ID` is auto-generated and is the primary reference point for any booking.
2. Date/Time in the Standard Format.
3. User will be a clickable link that goes to the [User Profile](/meetings/user/).
4. Filtered results will populat the `Centers`, `Floor`, `Room` Labels, and `Status` of the Meeting Rooms.
5. An Action button will allow users with User Rights to perform the required action.
