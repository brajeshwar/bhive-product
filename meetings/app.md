## Search

A universal `Search` bar will be at the top as an easy to type filterating option to find locations, features, and pricing of Meeting Rooms. This will also, eventually in future, be the same with Day-Passes and all other `Spaces` that we introduced with BHIVE.

## Filters

A user will also have the option to use the `Filters` for easy selection choices.

Once a user starts using the `Filters`, the `Search` bar will go up and can always be pulled down with the `Rubberband Action`.

The Filters brings up the `Filters` card with options;

- Date: Fires the Calendar Widget to select a date or a date-range.
- Time: A time slider for the selected date.
- Seating Capacity
- Room Types
- Amenities / Features

## Meeting Room Cards

Search Result or Filtered Meeting Rooms are shown in Card View with Primary details such as seating capacity, location, and pricing which is highlighted.

## Book

Once the desired result is in place via the Search or the Filter options, a user can book for a price or skip to confirmation (for post-paid members).

## Payment

### Existing Customers with Hourly Credits

For existing customers, who have been granted hourly meeting credits, they will default to paying for the meeting rooms with their available credit. If the hourly meeting credit covers the cost, it will just go through to `Booking Confirmation` else, they will informed and accounts updated to reflect on their post-payment Monthly Invoice Item.

### New Customers With BHIVE Credits

For new customers, who will have BHIVE Credits or buy them, they will be able to redeem their credits. Day-Pass, and Walk-In Guests will have the option to pre-pay and confirm their booking. For Co-Working and Managed Office Customers, after redeeming their existing credits, can complete their booking. Any payments needed will become an Invoice Line Item in their next Monthly Billing Cycle.
