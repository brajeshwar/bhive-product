# App

The BHIVE Mobile App is the common entry funnel for Meetings, just as it is for Day-Passes.

## Search & Filter Bar

A universal `Search Bar` will be at the top as an easy to type filterating option to find locations, features, and pricing of Meeting Rooms. This will also, eventually in future, be the same with Day-Passes and all other `Spaces` that we introduced with BHIVE.

There will also be an easy to use `Filter Bar` for those who are more comfortable with `tap`, `tap`, `tap`.

Once a user starts using the `Filter Bar`, the `Search Bar` will go up and can always be pulled down with the `Rubberband Action`.

## Meeting Room Cards

Search Result or Filtered Meeting Rooms are shown in Card View with Primary details such as seating capacity, location, and pricing which is highlighted.
